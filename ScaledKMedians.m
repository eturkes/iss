% x_i is the i'th row of input matrix x (nPoints by nDims)
% g_i is a gain (not explicitly computed or returned)
% v_k is the k'th row of output v containing cluster medians (nClusters by nDims)
% k_i is the i'th entry of output k giving the cluster of each point (nPoints by 1)
% s2_k is the squared norm of v_k.
% 
% input v0 (nClusters by nDims) is the starting point. (Required.)
% 
% This assigns each row of x to a row of v based on dot product between
% normalised x and v. Then update v by taking median of all x assigned to
% that row of v.
